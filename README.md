# Datastructures
1. Doubly Linked List
2. Binary Tree
3. Array List

# Algorithms
### Sorting:
1. Bubble Sort
2. Quick Sort
### Searching:
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search

# Notes
1. Binary Search requires the list to be sorted and therefore Quick Sort is performed before Binary Search. The user will be informed of this.
2. The Binary Tree does support sorting but not partial sorting. For partial sort, the tree would have to be split up and merged back together which would ultimately lead to the same result as a full sort. Otherwise this would violate the rules of a binary tree. Therefore partial sort is not supported. THe user will be informed of this. 
3. The CSV file importer will only parse integers. Whilst the datastructures and algorithms implement a generic type, the CSV parser only takes integers. This can be changed if needed.
